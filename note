--They provide a lot of UI like providing various components we can put in our HTML pages
--Good pricing, as pricing model is what determines what payment system we deploy
    --The pricing plan is reasonably high because of the things we get for free like their UI components, Forms, with nice
        API thus saving us lots of time which is a trade-off here
--To move past the TEST API, we may have to use the "activate you account"

Stripe does collecting of payment details for us in a PCI compliant way through Tokenization
Tokenization ensures that no sensitive card data ever needs to touch your server so that our integration can operate in 
    a PCE cqmpliant way. Card details are never fully revealed although Stripes Dashboard and API do provide limited
    information about the card (such as its last four digits, expiration date, and brand).
